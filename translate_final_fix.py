    "台灣228事件歷史論述實證解析": "Empirical Analysis of the Historical Narrative of the Taiwan 228 Incident",
    "Although the apparent trigger of the 228 Incident that erupted in 19472月27日台北市大稻埕發生的查緝私菸流血衝突，但促發全島性抗爭的深層結構性原因，實則源於戰後初期台灣特殊的政治與經濟統治架構。依據228事件紀念基金會委託多位歷史學者（包含黃秀政、薛化元、陳儀深、張炎憲、李筱峰、陳翠蓮等）共同撰寫，並於2006年出版之《228事件責任歸屬研究報告》，當時國民政府在台灣設立的「行政長官公署」制度，是一個高度集權的特殊體制。該體制將行政、立法、司法、人事與軍事大權集於行政長官陳儀一身，形成了一種在民主憲政體制外運作的專制統治架構。": "Although the apparent trigger of the 228 Incident that erupted in 1947 was the bloodshed over contraband cigarette inspections in Dadaocheng, Taipei on February 27, the deep structural causes that sparked the island-wide resistance actually stemmed from Taiwan's unique political and economic governance structure in the early postwar period. According to the 'Research Report on the Responsibility for the 228 Incident', co-authored by multiple historians (including Huang Hsiu-cheng, Hsueh Hua-yuan, Chen Yi-shen, Chang Yen-hsien, Lee Hsiao-feng, Chen Tsui-lien, etc.) commissioned by the Memorial Foundation of 228 and published in 2006, the 'Chief Executive's Office' system established by the Nationalist Government in Taiwan at that time was a highly centralized alternative system. This system concentrated administrative, legislative, judicial, personnel, and military powers in the hands of Chief Executive Chen Yi, forming an autocratic ruling structure operating outside the democratic constitutional system.",
    "在經濟資源分配層面，政府實施了極為嚴格的物資管制與專賣制度，將菸、酒、火柴等民生必需品納入政府獨佔，加上戰後初期百廢待舉、物資短缺，以及政府將大量台灣米糧運往中國大陸支援國共內戰，導致台灣本地爆發嚴重的通貨膨脹與大規模失業，民生凋敝至極。在政治權力分配層面，外省籍官員幾乎壟斷了所有政府高層與公營事業的決策職位，且官場貪污腐化現象頻傳；與此同時，來台駐守的軍隊軍紀敗壞，屢屢發生欺壓百姓的事件。這種由上而下、全面性的制度性剝奪與文化隔閡，導致台灣社會從知識份子、地方仕紳到普羅大眾，對陳儀政府累積了極度的不滿與絕望。因此，當查緝私菸的偶發暴力事件發生後，長期受到壓抑的民怨瞬間爆發。民間菁英在事件初期迅速組成「228事件處理委員會」，其核心訴求並非官方當時宣稱的武裝叛亂或尋求台灣獨立，而是強烈「要求政治改革」、「opposed political monopoly,\" and \"fought against corruption.\" ": "In terms of economic resource distribution, the government implemented extremely strict material control and monopoly systems, bringing daily necessities such as tobacco, alcohol, and matches into government monopoly. Coupled with the postwar depression, material shortages, and the government transporting large amounts of Taiwanese rice to mainland China to support the Chinese Civil War, Taiwan experienced severe inflation and massive unemployment, leaving the people destitute. In terms of political power distribution, Mainlander officials almost monopolized all decision-making positions in top government tiers and state-owned enterprises, and official corruption was rampant. Meanwhile, the troops stationed in Taiwan had poor military discipline, frequently bullying civilians. This top-down, comprehensive institutional deprivation and cultural alienation led to extreme dissatisfaction and despair towards Chen Yi's government among Taiwanese society, from intellectuals and local gentry to the general public. Therefore, when the accidental violent incident of contraband cigarette inspection occurred, the long-suppressed public anger erupted instantly. Local elites quickly formed the '228 Incident Settlement Committee' in the early stages of the event. Its core demand was not the armed rebellion or seeking Taiwan independence that officials claimed at the time, but strongly 'demanding political reform', 'opposing political monopoly', and 'fighting against corruption'.",
    "在探討責任歸屬的嚴肅課題上，歷史研究報告明確指出，當時的國民政府主席蔣中正是事件中必須承擔最大與最終責任的最高決策者。儘管在事件爆發初期，部分台灣民間菁英團體以及某些情報管道曾試圖向南京中央傳達台灣社會的真實訴求與官逼民反的真相，蔣中正最終仍選擇採信台灣省行政長官陳儀、國民黨台灣省黨部主委李翼中等地方軍政首長的偏頗匯報。這些報告刻意將民間的改革訴求扭曲為「奸匪煽動」、「暴民叛亂」以及「日本奴化教育餘毒」的展現。基於這些資訊，蔣中正做出了派遣大軍赴台進行軍事鎮壓的致命決定。": "In exploring the serious issue of responsibility, historical research reports clearly point out that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nationalist Government at the time, was the highest decision-maker who must bear the greatest and ultimate responsibility for the incident. Although in the early stages of the outbreak, some Taiwanese civilian elite groups and certain intelligence channels attempted to convey the true demands of Taiwanese society and the reality of officials forcing the people to rebel to the central government in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek ultimately chose to believe the biased reports of local military and political leaders such as Chen Yi, Chief Executive of Taiwan Province, and Lee Yi-chung, Chairman of the KMT Taiwan Provincial Committee. These reports deliberately distorted civilian reform demands as 'instigated by treacherous bandits', 'rioter rebellion', and the manifestation of 'the remnants of Japanese enslavement education'. Based on this information, Chiang Kai-shek made the fatal decision to dispatch a large army to Taiwan for military suppression.",
    "軍隊於1947年3月8日陸續自基隆與高雄登陸後，隨即在全台各地展開被稱為「綏靖」與「清鄉」的血腥行動。在此過程中，台灣省行政長官兼警備總司令陳儀負有不可推卸的軍政首長責任，而其下屬如警備總部參謀長柯遠芬、高雄要塞司令彭孟緝、基隆要塞司令史宏熹、整編第二十一師師長劉雨卿等人，在執行鎮壓任務時，採取了極度不成比例的武力。軍隊不僅在市區進行無差別的機槍掃射，更配合情治單位展開大規模的濫捕、未經合法審判的密裁與私人處決。": "After the troops landed successively from Keelung and Kaohsiung on March 8, 1947, they immediately launched bloody operations called 'pacification' and 'village cleansing' across Taiwan. In this process, Chen Yi, Chief Executive of Taiwan Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Garrison Command, bore inescapable responsibility as the military and political head. His subordinates, such as Ke Yuan-fen (Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command), Peng Meng-ji (Kaohsiung Fortress Commander), Shih Hung-hsi (Keelung Fortress Commander), and Liu Yu-ching (Commander of the Reorganized 21st Division), employed extremely disproportionate force when carrying out suppression missions. The army not only indiscriminately machine-gunned urban areas but also collaborated with intelligence agencies to conduct large-scale indiscriminate arrests, secret assassinations without legal trial, and private executions.",
    "這種國家機器的殘酷運作，不僅造成無數無辜平民的傷亡，更針對性地消滅了整整一代的台灣地方菁英。據統計，當時高達八成的各縣市參議員、醫師、律師、作家與媒體人在此次鎮壓中遇害或失蹤，對台灣的司法界、新聞界及校園（教育界）造成了無法彌補的毀滅性衝擊。更甚者，蔣中正在事件後非但沒有懲處濫殺無辜的軍政首長，反而將陳儀升任浙江省主席、將彭孟緝擢升為台灣省警備總司令。此種未經正當法律程序、由國家最高權力核心發動並背書的群體性暴力，確立了228事件在現代史學、政治學與法學上作為「國家不法侵害」與「威權國家恐怖主義」的核心定調。": "The cruel operation of this state apparatus not only caused countless innocent civilian casualties but also specifically eliminated an entire generation of Taiwanese local elites. According to statistics, up to 80% of county and city councilors, doctors, lawyers, writers, and journalists at the time were killed or went missing in this suppression, causing an irreparable and devastating blow to Taiwan's judiciary, journalism, and campuses (education sector). Even worse, after the incident, rather than punishing the military and political leaders who slaughtered innocents, Chiang Kai-shek promoted Chen Yi to Governor of Zhejiang Province and elevated Peng Meng-ji to Commander-in-Chief of the Taiwan Garrison Command. This mass violence, lacking due process and initiated and endorsed by the state's highest core of power, established the 228 Incident's core definition in modern historiography, political science, and jurisprudence as 'state illegal infringement' and 'authoritarian state terrorism'.",
    "228事件中「究竟有多少人死亡或失蹤」，一直是半個多世紀以來歷史論述中最具爭議、也最容易被各方政治勢力與當代網路認知作戰挪用的議題。從數千人到十數萬人不等，不同政治立場的論述者往往選擇性地採用特定數據來支持其政治議程或抹黑對手。要徹底釐清傷亡數據的真相，必須嚴格區分「歷史文獻估計」、「人口統計學推估」以及「轉型正義補償實證審查」三個截然不同的測量維度與科學方法論。": "In the 228 Incident, 'exactly how many people died or went missing' has been the most controversial issue in historical narratives for over half a century, and the easiest to be appropriated by various political forces and contemporary online cognitive warfare. Ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands, commentators with different political stances often selectively use specific data to support their political agendas or smear opponents. To thoroughly clarify the truth about casualty data, one must strictly distinguish between three distinct measurement dimensions and scientific methodologies: 'historical literature estimation', 'demographic projection', and 'transitional justice compensation empirical review'.",
    "在事件發生當時及隨後的幾年間，各方人士基於不同的情報來源與政治目的，提出了差異極大的傷亡數據。為了清晰呈現這些歷史估算的複雜性，以下透過結構化資料展示各方宣稱的數字：": "During the incident and in the following years, various parties proposed vastly different casualty figures based on different intelligence sources and political purposes. To clearly present the complexity of these historical estimates, structured data below illustrates the numbers claimed by various parties:",
    "資料來源 / Reporter Identity": "Source / Reporter Identity",
    "從上述表格可以清晰看出，當時的官方報告（如白崇禧的1,860人）與外國觀察家、民間人士的估算（如葛超智的兩萬人）存在著巨大的鴻溝。國史館學者侯坤宏曾分析，官方報告極度低估數字，是因為其刻意忽略了大量未經正式審判即遭軍隊秘密處決、或直接被拋入海中與掩埋的非正常途徑死亡人數；而民間或海外報告的高估，則可能混雜了當時社會極度恐慌下的道聽塗說與刻意渲染。此外，《228事件研究報告》總主筆賴澤涵亦指出，國民黨部隊於3月8日登陸後，單是子彈就消耗了14萬發，造成的死傷絕對遠超官方承認的數千人；但若說死亡人數高達數萬人，在當時的時空背景下，屍體的處理與掩埋在短短數週內亦難以完全不留痕跡，因此雙方極端的數字皆有討論空間。": "It is clear from the table above that there was a massive gulf between the official reports of the time (e.g., Bai Chongxi's 1,860) and the estimates of foreign observers and civilians (e.g., George H. Kerr's 20,000). Academia Historica scholar Hou Kun-hung once analyzed that official reports severely underestimated the numbers because they deliberately ignored the massive number of unnatural deaths—those secretly executed by the army without formal trial or thrown directly into the sea or buried; meanwhile, overestimations in civilian or overseas reports might have been mixed with hearsay and deliberate exaggeration amidst extreme societal panic. Moreover, Lai Tse-han, chief author of the 'Research Report on the 228 Incident', pointed out that after KMT troops landed on March 8, they expended 140,000 rounds of ammunition; the resulting casualties absolutely exceeded the thousands officially acknowledged. However, to say that the death toll was in the tens of thousands, under the space-time context of the time, the processing and burial of corpses would be difficult to leave entirely no trace within just a few weeks. Hence, there is room for discussion regarding the extreme numbers from both sides.",
    "為了在缺乏完整屍骨與名單的情況下尋求科學解答，1992年由李登輝總統任內推動、行政院出版的《228事件研究報告》中，學者陳寬政採用了「人口學推計」模型進行估算。其研究方法的核心假設在於：由於1946年台灣並無精確的年度死亡統計，故比較1947年與1948年的總死亡人數。數據顯示，1947年（事件發生年）全台總死亡人數為114,192人，而1948年為95,340人；1947年比1948年多出了18,856名死者。陳寬政進一步將1947年15歲至64歲男性死亡人數高於1948年的異常增量，全數歸因於228事件的政治鎮壓，進而推估出事件死亡人數約落在18,352人至27,923人之間。另一位學者李喬亦利用線性迴歸模型，推估出18,446人至19,646人的相近數據。這些數字隨後被廣泛引用，甚至寫入部分高中教材中。": "Seeking scientific answers without complete remains and rosters, scholar Chen Kuan-cheng employed a 'demographic projection' model in the 'Research Report on the 228 Incident', promoted during President Lee Teng-hui's tenure and published by the Executive Yuan in 1992. The core assumption of this methodology was: lacking precise annual death statistics for 1946 in Taiwan, it compared total deaths between 1947 and 1948. Data showed 114,192 total deaths island-wide in 1947 (the incident year) and 95,340 in 1948; 1947 exceeded 1948 by 18,856 deaths. Chen Kuan-cheng further attributed the entire abnormal increment in deaths among males aged 15 to 64 in 1947 over 1948 to the political suppression of the 228 Incident, consequently estimating the incident's death toll to fall between 18,352 and 27,923. Another scholar, Li Chiao, also utilized a linear regression model to project similar figures of 18,446 to 19,646. These numbers were subsequently widely cited, even being written into some high school textbooks.",
    "然而，此種純粹依賴人口死亡總數波動的推演方法，在學術界與實務界受到了極為嚴厲的挑戰與批評。前立法委員蔡正元與部分公共衛生專家透過客觀的流行病學證據指出，1947年恰逢戰後台灣公共衛生體系崩潰、島內傳染病（如天花、霍亂、瘧疾等）大規模橫行的時期，年度整體死亡人數必然較其他相對平穩的年度偏高。將因傳染病或其他社會動盪導致的「超額死亡人數」全數算入228事件的鎮壓死難者，在科學方法論上犯了嚴重的「過度推論」與「歸因謬誤」。此外，中央研究院院士胡佛作為當年研究報告的審議委員之一，亦曾公開指出，從戰後初期的台灣整體人口波動來換算單一政治事件的死亡人數，存在巨大的盲點。當時台灣社會經歷了劇烈的人口流動，包括大量滯留中國大陸未歸的台灣兵、前往大陸參與國共內戰的老兵，以及事件發生後因恐懼而逃回大陸的外省人士。在戶籍系統紊亂且人口頻繁跨境移動的背景下，單憑戶籍死亡登記數量的差額來斷定數萬人死於屠殺，被認為是缺乏周詳考量的誇大之詞。": "However, this deductive method relying purely on total demographic death fluctuations faced extremely severe challenges and criticism from academia and the practical realm. Former legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan and some public health experts pointed out through objective epidemiological evidence that 1947 coincided with the collapse of postwar Taiwan's public health system and massive epidemics of infectious diseases (such as smallpox, cholera, malaria). Hence, the annual overall death toll was inevitably higher than other relatively stable years. Counting the 'excess deaths' caused by infectious diseases or other social upheavals entirely as victims of the 228 suppression commits severe 'over-inference' and 'attribution fallacy' in scientific methodology. Additionally, Academia Sinica Academician Hu Fu, one of the reviewing members of that year's research report, publicly noted huge blind spots in calculating deaths of a single political event from the overall population fluctuation in early postwar Taiwan. Taiwanese society then experienced drastic population mobility, including many Taiwanese conscripts stranded in mainland China, veterans going to the mainland for the civil war, and Mainlanders fleeing back in fear after the incident. Amidst chaotic household registration systems and frequent cross-border movements, arbitrarily concluding tens of thousands died from massacre solely based on the difference in household death registrations was considered an ill-considered exaggeration.",
    "當代網路帳號在攻擊「民進黨操弄228」時，最常使用的一項核心論述便是宣稱「外省人死傷數字比本省人還多」，並指控政府與228基金會刻意掩蓋外省籍受難者的史實，試圖將228事件從「國家對人民的鎮壓」扭曲為單純的「本省人對外省人的族群屠殺」。此一論述的主要依據，多來自當時上海《大公報》駐地記者唐賢龍所著之《台灣事變內幕記》，其引述當時警察單位公布的數字稱：外省人死亡432人、失蹤85人、受傷2,126人，受難總數高達2,643人。攻擊者據此對比228基金會早期認定的本省受難人數（約二千餘人），得出外省人受害更深的結論。": "When attacking 'DPP manipulation of 228', contemporary internet accounts frequently employ a core narrative claiming 'Mainlander casualties outnumbered Taiwanese', accusing the government and the 228 Foundation of deliberately covering up historical facts about Mainlander victims, attempting to twist the 228 Incident from 'state suppression of the people' into a mere 'ethnic massacre of Mainlanders by Taiwanese'. The primary basis for this narrative mostly comes from 'Inside the Taiwan Incident' authored by Tang Hsien-lung, a resident reporter for Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao, who cited police statistics at the time claiming: 432 Mainlanders dead, 85 missing, 2,126 injured, totaling 2,643 victims. Attackers contrast this with the early number of Taiwanese victims recognized by the 228 Foundation (over two thousand), thereby concluding Mainlanders suffered more deeply.",
    "然而，這種刻意擷取單一早期官方文獻的論述，完全禁不起現代歷史檔案學的嚴格檢驗。228事件紀念基金會深知此議題的重要性，在其後續擴充出版的《228事件真相與轉型正義研究報告》中，特別委託學者新增了〈試論228事件中的外省人傷亡〉與〈官方紀錄中228事件死難人數探析〉等專文，針對外省人傷亡數據進行了極度細緻的檔案比對與考證。經過嚴謹的實證研究發現，當時政府高層與軍政系統為了向南京中央證明派遣大軍鎮壓的「正當性」與「急迫性」，刻意在公文中使用了極度模糊的「死傷」一詞，將大量的「輕微擦傷」、「財物損失」與「死亡」混為一談，藉此誇大外省人的實際死亡規模。更有甚者，部分官方報告甚至將死於軍隊無差別掃射的本省人數據，或是本省籍公務員的死傷，移花接木並計入外省公務員的死傷數中。": "However, this narrative, which deliberately extracts a single early official document, completely fails to withstand the rigorous examination of modern historical archives. The Memorial Foundation of 228 deeply understood the importance of this issue. In its subsequently expanded publication 'Research Report on the Truth and Transitional Justice of the 228 Incident', it specifically commissioned scholars to add monographs like 'Discussion on Mainlander Casualties in the 228 Incident' and 'Analysis of the Official Records of the 228 Incident Death Toll', conducting extremely detailed archival cross-checking and textology on Mainlander casualty data. Rigorous empirical research revealed that high-level government and military systems at the time, to prove to the central government in Nanjing the 'legitimacy' and 'urgency' of dispatching armies for suppression, deliberately used the extremely vague term 'casualties' in official documents. They conflated vast numbers of 'minor scratches' and 'property losses' with 'deaths', thereby exaggerating the actual scale of Mainlander deaths. Furthermore, some official reports even grafted the data of Taiwanese killed by the army's indiscriminate machine-gunning, or Taiwanese civil servant casualties, incorporating them into the casualty figures for Mainlander civil servants.",
    "根據基金會窮盡現有檔案考證後的最終結論：在228事件中，外省人的確在初期因群眾失控而遭到波及，但其真實的死亡與失蹤合計總數為": "According to the Foundation's final conclusion after exhaustive archival research: In the 228 Incident, Mainlanders were indeed implicated initially due to masses losing control, but their actual combined total of dead and missing was ",
    "89人；其中因族群衝突被民間群眾毆打致死的外省公務員有 38人，一般外省民眾有 8人。其餘的外省受難者多為受傷（共1,389人）。": "89 people; of which 38 were Mainlander civil servants beaten to death by civilian crowds due to ethnic conflict, and 8 were ordinary Mainlander citizens. The remaining Mainlander victims were mostly injured (totaling 1,389).",
    "這一基於官方檔案比對的鐵證，直接且徹底地反駁了「外省人死亡人數大於本省人」的網路虛假論述。外省族群在事件初期的確面臨了部分台灣民間群眾的暴力相向，這反映了當時社會因語言不通、文化摩擦與對貪腐政權憤怒所導致的群眾失控；然而，將這種長達數天的「群眾盲目暴力（Horizontal": "This ironclad evidence based on official archival cross-checking directly and thoroughly refutes the online false narrative that 'Mainlander deaths outnumbered Taiwanese'.

    "在當前的數位認知作戰中，除了宏觀數據的爭辯外，攻擊者亦經常透過放大檢視特定歷史個案，藉此質疑《228事件處理及賠償條例》的payment standards harbor political bias and ethnic discrimination.其中，專欄作家張若彤所提出的「劉青山案」與「何鑾旗案」之對比，便是近期網路上被廣泛引用，用以指控官方「淡化歷史」、「選擇性給予正義」的典型案例。要釐清此類指控，必須深入探討轉型正義的法理基礎與法律要件。": "In current digital cognitive warfare, beyond macroeconomic debates, attackers frequently zoom in to scrutinize specific historical cases, thereby questioning that the compensation standards of the '228 Incident Disposition and Compensation Act' harbor political bias and ethnic discrimination. Among them, the comparison between the 'Liu Ching-shan Case' and the 'Ho Luan-chi Case' raised by columnist Chang Jo-tung is a typical and widely cited example online, utilized to accuse officials of 'downplaying history' and 'selectively granting justice'. To clarify such accusations, one must delve deeply into the jurisprudential foundations and legal requisites of transitional justice.",
    "劉青山案的歷史還原：": "Historical Restoration of the Liu Ching-shan Case:",
    "何鑾旗案的曲折歷程：": "The Tortuous Course of the Ho Luan-chi Case:",
    "將此標準套用於劉青山案：劉青山身為執行公務的專賣局官員，其在衝突中遭到民眾毆打甚至殘忍殺害，在法律性質上屬於一般刑法中的「殺人罪」與「群眾暴動罪」。在當時的時空背景下，國民政府作為實質控制台灣的統治實體，依然握有強大的司法調查與武力懲凶的權力。換言之，劉青山雖然是悲劇的受害者，但他面對的是「平民的非法暴力（Horizontal": "Applying this standard to the Liu Ching-shan case: As a Monopoly Bureau official executing public duties, Liu Ching-shan was beaten and even brutally murdered by the masses during the conflict. Legally, this falls under generic criminal code offenses like 'homicide' and 'riot'.

    "相對地，檢視何鑾旗案：即便何鑾旗在事件初期曾面臨參與暴動的指控，且後來經法院判決無罪，但他最終面臨的是擁有絕對生殺大權、不受制衡的「國家軍事體系與情治機關」。警備總部在缺乏正當法律程序保障的情況下，以莫須有的政治與經濟罪名將其槍決，這正是標準的「由上而下的體制性暴力（Vertical": "Conversely, examining the Ho Luan-chi case: Even though Ho Luan-chi faced accusations of participating in the riot initially, and was later pronounced innocent by the court, what he ultimately confronted was the 'state military system and intelligence agencies', which possessed absolute power of life and death without checks and balances. Lacking guarantees of due process, the Garrison Command executed him on trumped-up political and economic charges. This is classic 'Vertical top-down institutional violence'.",

    "針對被中共奉為武裝革命圭臬的「二七部隊」，前二七部隊部隊長鍾逸人曾以親歷者的身分公開澄清：外界認為是謝雪紅「組織或號召」了二七部隊的說法，是完全錯誤的歷史想像。真實的歷史脈絡是，1947年3月初，台中地區的民眾因不滿政府鎮壓，自發性地包圍公署與警局並接收武器，隨後成立了這支武裝民兵。其首要目的是在「政府體制完全失能的情況下，由民間力量自主維護社會治安與秩序」，並在國軍第21師逼近台中時，承擔起撤退至埔里進行抵抗的防禦任務。謝雪紅之所以加入並參與領導二七部隊，很大程度上是因為她在當時面臨政敵或情治人員的暗殺威脅，必須尋求這支強大民間武裝力量的保護，而非由她單方面創建並指揮該部隊進行共產革命。228事件紀念基金會董事長薛化元亦強調，當時地下共產黨的人數極少，對228整起事件的影響極其有限，絕未扮演關鍵的轉折角色。": "Regarding the '27 Brigade', enshrined by the CCP as a paragon of armed revolution, former 27 Brigade commander Chung Yi-jen, in his capacity as an eyewitness, once publicly clarified: The external claim that Hsieh Hsueh-hung 'organized or rallied' the 27 Brigade is entirely erroneous historical imagination. The true historical context is that in early March 1947, Taichung citizens, dissatisfied with government suppression, spontaneously besieged public offices and police stations, gathered weapons, and subsequently established this armed militia. Its primary purpose was to 'autonomously maintain social security and order through civilian strength under a completely dysfunctional government system', and assumed the defensive mission of retreating to Puli to carry out resistance as the Nationalist Army's 21st Division approached Taichung. Hsieh Hsueh-hung joining and participating in leading the 27 Brigade was largely because she then faced assassination threats from political rivals or intelligence personnel, requiring the protection of this formidable civilian armed force; it was not her unilaterally creating and commanding the brigade for communist revolution. Hsueh Hua-yuan, Chairman of the Memorial Foundation of 228, also emphasized that the underground Communist Party had extremely few members at the time; their influence on the entirety of the 228 Incident was exceedingly limited, absolutely averting any critical turning point role.",
    "這種「昔日的威權國民黨」與「當代的中國共產黨」在歷史論述上的弔詭匯流，至今仍是網路認知作戰中極具破壞力的一環。藉由將228事件與「共產黨武裝叛亂」強行掛鉤，攻擊者不僅能夠在內部稀釋國家機關當年動用軍隊屠殺平民的不正當性（將其合理化為剿共戰爭），亦能作為當代政治鬥爭的武器，指責推動轉型正義的民進黨政府「實則是在為共產黨匪諜平反」。為此，權威研究報告明確剖析了民間自發性的民主抗爭，與隨後在白色恐怖時期真正涉入中共地下黨活動者之間，存在著嚴格的時間斷裂與動機差異，絕不應被粗暴地化約為單一共產叛亂事件。": "This paradoxical convergence in historical narratives between the 'former authoritarian KMT' and 'contemporary CCP' remains a highly destructive link in online cognitive warfare today. By forcibly linking the 228 Incident with 'Communist armed rebellion', attackers not only internally dilute the illegitimacy of state organs mobilizing the army to massacre civilians back then (rationalizing it as an anti-communist war), but also can utilize it as a weapon in contemporary political struggles, accusing the DPP government pushing for transitional justice of 'actually rehabilitating communist spies'. To this end, authoritative research reports definitively analyze that a strict temporal rupture and motivational discrepancy exist between spontaneous civilian democratic resistance and those truly involved in CCP underground party activities during the subsequent White Terror, categorically forbidding brutal reduction into a single communist rebellion event.",
    "「台灣事實查核中心」近期針對網路流傳甚廣的一則典型228相關假訊息發布了詳細的查核報告。該網路傳言將矛頭指向228國家紀念館前館長楊振隆，指稱：「楊振隆曾因殺人案服刑，後由蔡英文、蘇貞昌共同提名擔任館長，坐領月薪30萬元，並享有政務官退休18%的優惠存款福利」。經過查核中心向相關單位調閱資料並進行實地查證，發現這則訊息運用了資訊戰中最經典的「七分真、三分假」與「張冠李戴」操弄手法。傳言中關於楊振隆過去在年輕時期曾犯下案件並入獄服刑的背景，確實「符合事實」；然而，傳言後半段所有用以激起民眾相對剝奪感與仇恨情緒的財務與制度指控，包括「由總統府或行政院直接提名制度（實則由基金會董事會聘任）」、「月薪高達30萬」、「享有政務官18%優存福利」等內容，皆被證實為完全「不符合事實」的惡意捏造。": "The 'Taiwan FactCheck Center' recently issued a detailed verification report addressing a widely circulated piece of typical 228-related disinformation. That online rumor targeted Yang Chen-lung, former director of the National 228 Memorial Museum, alleging: 'Yang Chen-lung served time for homicide, was later jointly nominated by Tsai Ing-wen and Su Tseng-chang as director, drew a 300,000 NTD monthly salary, and enjoyed a preferential 18% retirement deposit rate as a political appointee.' Upon the FactCheck Center accessing records from relevant agencies and conducting on-site verifications, it uncovered that this message utilized the most classic information warfare manipulative tactics: 'seven parts truth, three parts lie' and 'misattribution'. The rumor's background regarding Yang Chen-lung having committed a crime and served prison time during his youth indeed 'conforms with facts'; however, the rumor's entire latter half consisting of financial and institutional accusations meant to incite public relative deprivation and hateful emotions—including the 'direct nomination system by the Presidential Office or Executive Yuan (actually hired by the Foundation's Board)', 'monthly salary up to 300,000 NTD', and 'enjoying political appointee 18% preferential deposit rate'—were all verified as utterly 'inconsistent with facts' malicious fabrications.",
    "此外，部分媒體或網路帳號亦會利用基金會內部對於統計數據的精進過程進行見縫插針。例如，首任館長廖繼斌曾對官方死難人數統計提出不同見解與挑戰，這本屬於學術與機構內部正常的討論範疇，基金會亦公開回應將持續進行校正與通盤整理。然而，這類正常的學術辯證，在有心人士的剪輯與渲染下，往往被扭曲為「官方承認數據造假」、「民進黨長期欺騙人民」的聳動標題，在社群網路上瘋狂轉載。": "Furthermore, some media or internet accounts will also exploit the Foundation's internal statistical refinement processes to sow discord. For instance, inaugural director Liao Chi-pin once raised different viewpoints and challenged official fatality numbers. This inherently belongs within the normal purview of intra-academic and intra-institutional discussion, which the Foundation also publicly answered it would continuously calibrate and comprehensively review. Still, under the editing and exaggeration of individuals with ulterior motives, such normal academic dialectics are frequently contorted into sensationalist headlines like 'Officials Admit Data Falsification' or 'DPP Long-terms Fools the People', spreading madly across social networks.",
    "這類將深刻的歷史悲劇轉化為「當代政治提款機」與「仇恨動員工具」的數位手段，其根本目的從來就不是為了追求或還原歷史真相，而是為了達成三個高度戰略性的政治效應：": "Such digital maneuvers that transmute profound historical tragedies into 'contemporary political ATMs' and 'hate mobilization tools' never primarily intend to pursue or restore historical truth, but achieve three highly strategic political effects:",
    "透過捏造極端誇張的薪資結構、特權福利（如30萬月薪、18%優存）或是刻意羅織受難者的犯罪背景，將推動與執行轉型正義的機構、學者與家屬，塑造成一群「掠奪國家資源的貪腐利益集團」。一旦社會大眾接受了這種設定，228紀念基金會所發布的任何嚴謹歷史真相與報告，便會自動喪失其道德制高點與公信力。": "Through fabricating extremely exaggerated salary structures and privileged benefits (like 300,000 NTD monthly salary, 18% preferential deposit), or deliberately weaving criminal backgrounds for victims, they mold the institutions, scholars, and families driving and executing transitional justice into a 'corrupt interest group plundering national resources'. Once the general public accepts this premise, any scrupulous historical truth and report published by the Memorial Foundation of 228 will automatically forfeit its moral high ground and credibility.",
    "面對國家暴力鐵證如山、無法辯駁的歷史事實，攻擊者往往採取「你也一樣」的防禦性反擊。透過無限放大個別外省籍受難者（如劉青山）在群眾衝突中的悲慘遭遇，或是指控本省受難者「其實都是共產黨同路人」，將一場由國家機器發動的體制性大屠殺，降格為單純的「族群互鬥」、「暴民作亂」或是「國共內戰的延伸」。這種策略成功地轉移了追究國家與獨裁者責任的焦點。": "Confronted by indisputable historical facts and a mountain of ironclad evidence of state violence, attackers habitually adopt a 'you are just the same' defensive counterattack. By infinitely amplifying the miserable encounters of distinct Mainlander victims (e.g., Liu Ching-shan) in mass conflicts, or alleging Taiwanese victims 'were actually all communist sympathizers', they demote an institutional massacre initiated by the state apparatus into sheer 'ethnic infighting', 'rioter chaos', or 'an extension of the Chinese Civil War'. This strategy successfully diverts the focus of pursuing the accountability of the state and the dictator."
